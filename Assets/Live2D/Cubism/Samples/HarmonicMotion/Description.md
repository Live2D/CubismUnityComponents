# Harmonic Motion

This sample demonstrates the Harmonic Motion functionality.
Harmonic Motion must be set up manually, but setting it up isn't too cumbersome.
Add a `CubismHarmonicMotionController` component to the game object model and add `CubismHarmonicMotionController` to the parameters you want to make harmonic motion.
